# The Programming Lang Bridge

As trained programmers no matter our native toungues we're able to pick up and get started writing code. In this modern day and age programming is more of a necessity. To help bridge the gap and get people started on coding we could start by bringing the language one step closer to students and bridging the gap.

## Hello World (Kannada)

```js
helu("Hello World!");
```

```cpp
#include "kannada.h"

int main() {
    helu << "Hello World!";
}
```

## Getting Started

The Lang Bridge is config driven. As an educator one can provide native alternatives to the English keywords that will help the student better get started. Once the configuration file is ready running the build tool should generate language specific run libraries the students can use.

## Considerations

### Alternative keywords really helpful?

Our brains take shortcuts to achieve the amazing feets of coordinated planned actions we do in our day to day. We have a lot of these shortcuts helping us read, listen and understand language everyday. Whether we realize it or not we benefit deeply from this when we pick up the computer to write code the very first time. We want to give people who talk other languages that exact leg up. There is a lot to learn from a basic control flow and specifying instructions to a computer. This should help students understand the basics of it.

### Why not simplify getting started writing code in C++ more?

More could've been done to simplify writing code in C++. We could've gotten rid of the main method or removed the need to using `<<` and `>>` operators for inputs and outputs. It's important that this approach should be a bridge to bring programmers over to more standard and universal programming languages. Writing means to alter the fundamental syntax of the language wouldn't benefit the students.
